    "Random forest results indicate that Entered and Job Creation.Count have the most effect on Births. Then the importance values drop off significantly. I discussed Job Creation.Count above with RFE and why I wouldn't use it in a model to predict Births. Entered is an interesting field. It is the number of establishments that entered during 'this' time (I'm assuming during the year of the record). Entering occurs when an establishment did not exist in the previous year. If that's the case, this feature does not relate to  Births directly since the firms that entered were not a part of the firms that created jobs in the past year (Births). This could indicate that the general trend of firms entering the market is affecting the Births. That is assuming my interpretation of these columns is correct. What is also interesting is Entered was very low on the RFE analysis. How can the two methods reveal so different results?"
